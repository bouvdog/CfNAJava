1. A garrison unit in its assignd hex occupies zero stacking space. In addition, an unlimited number of anti-aircraft
units may occupy a Major City hex at zero stacking space; three anti-aircraft units may occupy an Airfield hex at zero
stacking space while one anti-aircraft unit may occupy an Air Landing Strip at zero stacking space.

2. Vehicles other than light trucks, recce-type units, and motorcycle infantry may only enter/leave the hex on a
track. Motorized units may not engagae in combat into/out of a salt march (case 8.44)).

3. Light trucks, motorcycle recce-type units, and motorcycle infantry units may not enter, even via a track).

4. Alexandria and Cairo hexes are level three fortifications, all others are level two.

5. Commonwealth units may be able to use Rail Movement (case 8.7).

6. Negates all hexside terrain feature entry costs and breakdown point values.

7. Applies only to the units/truck points in that hex at that time.

8. Halves all terrain features entry costs and all hex/hexside breakdown points values except the CPA expended 
and the breakdown acquired by moving a vehicle down an escarpment.

9. Motorized units and trucks may only crass on a track.

10. May only be crossed during a rainstorm if the hexside is crossed by road or railroad (which is treated as a road
for this purpose) at a cost of two additional CPAs.

11. May only be crossed if the hexside is crossed by a road or a railroad. A motorized unit may so cross at no additional
CPA or breakdown points.

12. Armor targets receive the defensive benefit only if the hex is a major city hex.

13. Engineer units reduce the cost to enter (case 26.2). If assaulting forces are in an enemy minefield, the non-phasing 
forces receive L1 shifts for anti-armor and close assault if not already receiving them for occupying a friendly
minefield.
